            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The perfect burger! Juicy, savory, and perfect with a side of salty french fries. You can have them plain or with cheese. You can add toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, or pickles. Don't be scared to think outside the box!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>Cheddar cheese slices</li>
                <li>Soft potato bread buns</li>
                <li>Lettuce</li>
                <li>Tomato</li>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Pickles</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Separate the beef into 4 equal portions, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers (do it!). Gently roll each portion into balls then press down into round patties that are slightly larger than your bun to allow for shrinkage (12 cm / 4.7" wide, 1 cm / 0.4" thick for a 10cm / 4" burger bun).</li>
                <li>Get all your burger bits and pieces out and ready to use. Don't salt your beef until just before cooking (it toughens the meat).</li>
                <li>Preheat the grill to high. Place the bread cut face up on a tray and toast for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. (If using BBQ, place cut face down on the grill). Set aside.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle one side of patties with half the salt and pepper. Flip, then press a dent into the middle of each patty. (Prevents patties doming when cooking and reduces shrinkage!). Sprinkle this dented side with the remaining salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Preheat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot â€“ smoking hot!</li>
                <li>Cook 2 to 4 patties (whatever fits in the pan) for 1 1/2 minutes. Press down lightly with a spatula (not too hard else the meat juices squeeze out!). Flip, then immediately top with a slice of cheese. Cook for another 1 1/2 minutes (cheese will melt by itself!) then transfer burgers to a tray to rest for 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Slather the base of the bun with your sauce of choice. My order of assembly: lettuce, tomato, burger (x 2 for double!), gherkins, onion, sauce on bun lid, jam it on top of the stack.</li>
            </ol>
