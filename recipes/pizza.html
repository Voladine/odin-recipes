            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 package pizza dough</li>
                <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>All-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
                <li>Semolina, for dusting</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Divide the dough in half and let come to room temperature, uncovered, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, place a pizza stone or an inverted baking sheet on the oven floor and preheat to 500Ëš.</li>
                <li>On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out 1 piece of dough into a 12-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Dust a pizza peel or another inverted baking sheet with semolina and lay the dough on top.</li>
                <li>Spread half of the sauce on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Top with half of the mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Slide the pizza onto the hot stone or baking sheet and bake until the crust is browned and the cheese is melted, 10 to 12 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings. Makes 2 12-inch pizzas.</li>
